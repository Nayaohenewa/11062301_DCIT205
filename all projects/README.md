# GETTING STARTED
Getting started, i didnt know where to start from or what to do because this was my very first practical website though I practice this was kind of a 'big deal'
I navigated through youtube and found a particular channel [EJ MEDIA](https://www.youtube.com/@EJMedia1). He has various tutorials on most of the programming languages from html, javascript,php,css, etc 
Special Acknoledgement to the Lecturer and his Teaching assistants for giving as enough time to come up with our ideas and build this project.also a big thank you to [EJ MEDIA](https://www.youtube.com/@EJMedia1)
